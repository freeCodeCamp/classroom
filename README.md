[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 40,000 people get their first developer job. Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

# Classroom

> A self-hosted solution to help teachers plan and manage classroom-based learning, on top of freeCodeCamp's learn platform.

## Motivation

For a while now teachers have been asking for a way to get a birds eye view of multiple students who are progressing through the course. This is why we set out to make freeCodeCamp classroom mode, an interactive dashboard for teachers to view multiple freeCodeCamp users’ progress on their courses.
