echo https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_URL:8}/api/auth/callback/github
echo
echo 2.\) Set NEXTAUTH_URL in .env to https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_URL:8}
echo
echo 3.\) To setup GITHUB_ID and GITHUB_SECRET after setting up the OAuth app: 
echo      -Your Client ID is shown in the OAuth app page. Copy and paste to GITHUB_ID.
